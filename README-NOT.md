`lawn` is an R wrapper for the Javascript library [turf.js](https://turfjs.org/). In addition, we have a few functions to interface with the [geojson-random](https://github.com/mapbox/geojson-random) and [geojsonhint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/geojsonhint) Javascript libraries, for generating random GeoJSON objects and linting GeoJSON, respectively.
