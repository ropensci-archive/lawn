\title{Calculate a Planepoint}
\usage{
lawn_planepoint(pt, triangle, lint = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pt}{The Point for which a z-value will be calculated.}

\item{triangle}{A Polygon feature with three vertices.}

\item{lint}{(logical) Lint or not. Uses geojsonhint. Takes up increasing
time as the object to get linted increases in size, so probably use by
default for small objects, but not for large if you know they are good
geojson objects. Default: \code{FALSE}}
}
\value{
The z-value for pt (numeric).
}
\description{
Takes a triangular plane as a \link{data-Polygon} and a
\link{data-Point} within that triangle and returns the
z-value at that point.
}
\details{
The Polygon needs to have properties a, b, and c that define
the values at its three corners.
